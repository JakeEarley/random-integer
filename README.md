# random-integer
A random integer generator utilising JavaScript and CSS styling.

Two basic HTML textboxes take input for minimum and maximum integers. Once the button is clicked, a JavaScript function is called which returns a random integer value
between the given bounds. 
Checks should be made to ensure there will not be an error.

CSS styling should be modern and utilise a consistent colour scheme.
